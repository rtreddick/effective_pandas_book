# effective_pandas_book

I'm working through Effective Pandas 2 by Matt Harrison. I copied the code from his repo and have my own dir with notebooks where I'm repeating his exercises and sometimes experimenting with things. Just need a place to store this stuff in case there is a technique or example I want to reference later. He doesn't seem to have an updated the repo for Effective Pandas 2, so some of the code from his ipynb might differ slightly from what is in edition 2.
